| Choose Your Own Adventure |                 |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below:

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk - Tutorial Video
   https://getbootstrap.com/ - BootStrap Library Website
   MircroSoft Copilot - Debugging / Tutor

2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
   I will code along with the tutorial and then try to modify the code myself later.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
   I would like to submit a portfolio website, but if not then just a sandbox with all the things I end up making.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   I will work on this module Tuesdays and Thursdays at home on my computer.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan?
   A technical risk is that the setup might take longer than expected. The behavioral risk would be that I might still be behind on my other homework and not get around to finishing this one before I have to cram in time to do it.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here:
   https://github.com/zachmills2023/vite-project\

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:\
   https://youtu.be/2O6vx-mJzpI

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

| Question                                                     | Response |

| Are the links above public and working?                      | Yes      |
| Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module? | No       |
| Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                    | Yes      |
| Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                   | Yes      |
| Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder?  | Yes      |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module | 7:00                |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
   I don't think this sprint went very well to be completely honest. I struggled through this. I'm not sure why the setup takes me so long every time and following the tutorials
